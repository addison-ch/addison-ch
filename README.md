#### Hey there ~ <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="24px" alt="hi">

##### A bit about myself...
I'm a computer science major at the University of Waterloo, currently in my fourth year. I've taken (and really enjoyed) courses including Operating Systems, Software Security, and Computer Networks. Currently, I've completed 4 software engineering internships, and am seeking my fifth one for Summer 2025. 
- 🍏 Most recently I interned at **Apple** working on AirPlay.
- 🎮 Before that, I interned at Zynga working on serverless software for the FinOps team.
- 🧑‍💻 I've also done work with neural networks at Untether AI and full-stack development at the WSIB Innovation Lab!
- 🔨 I consider myself a generalist engineer -- I try to really understand how computers and systems work on a deeper level (as opposed to learning specific frameworks/libraries).
- 🌱 I'm constantly learning new things and building cool projects. Currently I'm learning more about Golang and GraphQL!
